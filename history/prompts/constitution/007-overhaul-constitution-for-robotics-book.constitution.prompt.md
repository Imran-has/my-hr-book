## Prompt

“Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book banana chata hu us k rule set kar k do

## Response snapshot

I have overhauled the constitution to align with your new project: a book on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". The constitution is now at version 2.0.0 and includes new principles focused on accuracy, safety, clarity, and ethics. I have also updated the plan template to reflect these new rules.
