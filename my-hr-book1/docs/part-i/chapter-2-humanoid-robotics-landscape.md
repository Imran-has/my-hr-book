# Chapter 2: The Humanoid Robotics Landscape

Humanoid robots—machines built in the likeness of the human body—represent one of the greatest ambitions within robotics. Their form is not merely for aesthetic appeal; it is a strategic choice. By building robots that share our basic structure, we design machines that can operate in a world built for humans. They can, in theory, use our tools, navigate our homes and workplaces, and interact with us in a natural, intuitive way.

This chapter provides a high-level survey of the modern humanoid robotics landscape, from pioneering research platforms to emerging commercial products.

### Key Players and Platforms

The field has been driven forward by a number of influential research labs and companies. We will explore the contributions and designs of key players, such as:

- **Boston Dynamics:** Known for the highly dynamic `Atlas` robot, which has demonstrated remarkable agility, including running, jumping, and performing complex gymnastics.
- **Honda:** A pioneer in the field with `ASIMO`, one of the first well-known humanoid robots capable of walking and interacting with people in a controlled environment.
- **Agility Robotics:** Developer of `Cassie` and `Digit`, bipedal robots designed for logistics and package delivery, showcasing a practical application of legged locomotion.
- **Tesla:** An entrant into the field with the `Optimus` (or Tesla Bot) project, aimed at creating a general-purpose humanoid for manufacturing and, eventually, everyday tasks.

### Core Design Philosophies

We will also compare and contrast the different approaches to humanoid design:

- **Fully Actuated vs. Underactuated Systems:** Why some designs prioritize direct control over every joint while others use passive dynamics to achieve more efficient movement.
- **Electric vs. Hydraulic Actuation:** The trade-offs between the speed and power of hydraulic systems and the precision and lower complexity of electric motors.
- **Sensing and Perception Suites:** A look at the typical arrangement of cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and joint encoders that allow these robots to perceive their environment and their own state.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear map of the major developments, key research questions, and commercial trends that are shaping the future of humanoid robotics.
